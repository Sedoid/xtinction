In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, making them our closest cousins after chimpanzees and bonobos. The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to more than 50, led by a dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for years. The bond between the silverback and his females forms the basis of gorilla social life. Females become sexually mature around seven or eight years old but don’t begin to breed until a couple of years later. Males mature at an even greater age. Once a female begins to breed, she'll likely give birth to only one baby every four to six years and only three or four over her entire lifetime. This low rate of reproduction makes it difficult for gorillas to recover from population declines. Both gorilla species have been decreasing in numbers for decades, and a 2010 United Nations report suggests that they may disappear from large parts of the Congo Basin by the mid-2020s.","images":["https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18330/images/hero_full/Mountain_Gorilla_Silverback_WW22557.jpg?1576515753","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18330/images/hero_small/Mountain_Gorilla_Silverback_WW22557.jpg?1576515753","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18331/images/story_full_width/Mountain_Gorilla_Uganda_WW267058.jpg?1576515791","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18331/images/carousel_small/Mountain_Gorilla_Uganda_WW267058.jpg?1576515791","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18333/images/story_full_width/Western_Lowland_Gorilla_Juvenile_Male_WW22718.jpg?1576515881","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18333/images/carousel_small/Western_Lowland_Gorilla_Juvenile_Male_WW22718.jpg?1576515881","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18328/images/story_full_width/Female_Mountain_Gorilla_with_Baby_WW2115796.jpg?1576515663","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18328/images/carousel_small/Female_Mountain_Gorilla_with_Baby_WW2115796.jpg?1576515663","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species_small/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/12806/images/priority_species/How-to-Help-gorilla.jpg?1479926484","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/12806/images/priority_species_small/How-to-Help-gorilla.jpg?1479926484"],"threat_title":"HABITAT LOSS","threat_body":["Only 17% of the gorilla population currently lives in protected regions, and vast areas of gorilla forest has already been lost.

In some areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tigers are still in crisis and declining in number.","images":["https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18134/images/hero_full/Medium_WW226365.jpg?1574452099","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18134/images/hero_small/Medium_WW226365.jpg?1574452099","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18125/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW246778.jpg?1574444328","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18125/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW246778.jpg?1574444328","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18126/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW247460.jpg?1574444470","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18126/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW247460.jpg?1574444470","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18127/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW251528.jpg?1574444517","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18127/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW251528.jpg?1574444517","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18133/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW250761.jpg?1574445844","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18133/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW250761.jpg?1574445844","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18135/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW226828.jpg?1574451081","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18135/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW226828.jpg?1574451081","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18134/images/priority_species/Medium_WW226365.jpg?1574452099","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18134/images/priority_species_small/Medium_WW226365.jpg?1574452099","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18841/images/priority_species/tiger-plush-2020.jpg?1585835134","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18841/images/priority_species_small/tiger-plush-2020.jpg?1585835134"],"threat_title":"Protecting Tigers","threat_body":["Poaching is the most immediate threat to wild tigers. Every part of the tiger—from whisker to tail—has been found in illegal wildlife markets. A result of persistent demand, their bones, and other body parts are used for modern health tonics and folk remedies, and their skins are sought after as status symbols among some Asian cultures.","There are often limited resources for guarding protected areas in the countries where tigers live. Even countries with strong enforcement of tiger protection laws continue to fight a never-ending battle against poaching, which is now often orchestrated by transnational crime syndicates that rake in significant profits from wildlife crime and undermine the security of local communities.","The impact from the death of a single tiger at the hands of poachers reaches beyond one single loss. If a female tiger with cubs is killed, her cubs will most likely die without their mother, and the female's potential for future breeding is lost. If a male is killed, his death can result in intense competition for his territory among surviving males in the population, leading to potential injury and death.","WWF works to enforce zero tolerance for tiger poaching across Asia. We help build the capacity of government enforcement units in each landscape and install the best new technologies to assist local agencies by achieving conservation results.

Those remaining rhinos live in fragmented, isolated areas and are prone to inbreeding, as healthy genetic mixing is more difficult among smaller groups. Also, having a large population confined to one protected area can lead to the allele effect where breeding is depressed due to lack of resources and disease can spread rapidly through these highly-concentrated populations.","The increase in human populations also puts more pressure on rhino habitats as well, shrinking the living space for rhinos and increasing the likelihood of contact with humans—often with fatal results.","WWF has a long history of supporting rhino translocations with the aim to establish new populations within their former range and move animals from risk areas to safe havens. In South Africa, WWF, in partnership with Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and Eastern Cape Parks and Tourismand partners started the Black Rhino Ranger Expansion Project (BBREP) in 2003. Since its start, the project  has helped successfully establish 12 new black rhino populations in safer, more spacious locations within their former range and relocated a total of 201 critically endangered black rhinos. During translocations, some rhinos are airlifted by helicopter. They are first sedated and then carefully airlifted to awaiting vehicles which take them to their new locations. Translocations reduce pressure on existing wildlife reserves and provide new territory within their former range where rhinos have a greater opportunity to increase in number. Creating more dispersed and better protected populations also helps keep rhinos safe from poachers.","In Asia, a number of successful translocations have been conducted in both India and Nepal, where the translocation process is slightly different from Africa. In Asia, candidates for translocation are tracked in their grassland habitat with the help of park and research staff and their captive elephant teams.

A temporary fence was also built to protect the area and allow iguanas to pass through.","images":["https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18414/images/hero_full/Medium_WW288386.jpg?1578346424","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18414/images/hero_small/Medium_WW288386.jpg?1578346424","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18413/images/story_full_width/Medium_WW288384.jpg?1578346178","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/18413/images/carousel_small/Medium_WW288384.jpg?1578346178","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species_small/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/6539/images/priority_species/Iguana-Adoption_03.12.2014_Help.jpg?1394644084","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/6539/images/priority_species_small/Iguana-Adoption_03.12.2014_Help.jpg?1394644084"],"threat_title":null,"threat_body":[],"_type":"dict"},{"name":null,"status":"\n                    Least Concern\n                  ","sci_name":"Ara ararauna ","places":null,"desc":" ","images":["https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/291/images/hero_full/Macaw_hero_image_%28c%29_Zig_Koch_WWF.jpg?1345568195","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/291/images/hero_small/Macaw_hero_image_%28c%29_Zig_Koch_WWF.jpg?1345568195","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/11623/images/priority_species_small/elephants_108954.jpg?1463511763","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/12811/images/priority_species/How-to-Help-macaw.jpg?1479927399","https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/12811/images/priority_species_small/How-to-Help-macaw.jpg?1479927399"],"threat_title":null,"threat_body":[],"_type":"dict"},{"name":"Loggerhead Turtle","status":"\n                    Vulnerable\n                  ","sci_name":"Caretta caretta","weight":"\n                    175-400 pounds\n                  ","length":"\n                    33-48 inches\n                  ","babitats":"\n                    Oceans\n                  ","places":null,"desc":"Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins.
